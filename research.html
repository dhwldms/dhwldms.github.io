            <h2>Immunology</h2>
            <p>My research in immunology focuses on understanding the immune response mechanisms at the molecular and cellular levels. I explore the pathways that regulate immune cell activation, differentiation, and memory formation.</p>

        <div class="research-item">
            <h2>Metabolic Biology</h2>
            <p>I investigate the intersection between metabolic processes and immune functions. Understanding how metabolic changes influence immune responses could lead to better therapeutic approaches for diseases like cancer and autoimmune disorders.</p>

            <h2>Biomedical Applications</h2>
            <p>My work aims to apply fundamental research in immunology and metabolism to real-world biomedical challenges, particularly in the development of targeted therapies and innovative diagnostic tools for complex diseases.</p>
